# ANN_Classification_Regression_By_The_AI

* I tried ANN for classification and regression problems. I included all the necessary theories required to write a code in my notebook. I tried to do code in as simple as possible manner that everyone could understand. If you 
  are a beginner then this repository could be the best start for you if you want to know about ANN.
